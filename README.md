# OutResourceProgram

SRMIST has a outResource Program, where the college teaches programming and developing softwares for free to the society, mostly to the School Students.

I was the Speaker of the Android Development Program, Where I have taught the school students to develope and deploy android applications. This repository contains all the code that I have used to teach them and also the codes of the live coding sessions.
